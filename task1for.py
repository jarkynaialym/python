# 1 Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.

 
# sum = 0 
# for i in range(1, 101): 
#      sum += i
#       print(i)


# 2 Create a counter that count downs from 100 to 1, print out the counter


# for i in range (100,0, -1):  #100- starter, 0-finish -1 - down
#           print(i)

# 3 Create a list ranging from 0..10, then using a for loop iterate through the list, and print out only even numbers not including 0.

# val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,]
# for i in range val:
#      if i % 2 == 0 and i != 0:
 #       print (i)


# 4 Print a multiplication table of a number given by the user (eg: inp=5, #5 * 0 = 0, 5 * 1 = 5, 5 * 2 = 10

# val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,]

# number = int (input("enter number"))
# for i in val:
#   print(f"{number}*{i} is {number*i}")


#5  print number from 0 to 99
# for each 3rd add Foo
# for each 5th add Bar
# for each 10th add Buzz

# for i in range (100):
#     output= str(i)
#     if i % 3 == 0:
#         output = output + "Foo"
#     if i % 5 == 0:
#         output = output + "Bar"
#     if i % 10 == 0:
#         output = output + "Buzz"   

#     print(output)
